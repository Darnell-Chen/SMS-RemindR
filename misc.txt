Purpose: The purpose of this file is to provide instructions for accessing certain things in the MERN. 

***Accessing Database using MongoDB
-To access the database, refer to the following steps: 1) If you haven't already, use this link to download
MongoDB on your system: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community-kubernetes-operator . This will give you access
to the keyword used to initialize the db on your system. 2) Use the following link to download the mongodb shell: 
https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell . This gives you the environment for navigating through the database upon intialization.
After downloading both, take the time to set up environment variables for the bin folders for mongoDB and the mongo shell respectively.
3) After that is complete, open up a ps terminal and navigate to the mern project directory[or wherever you have cloned this 
repository]. Next, navigate to the server folder and then type the followign command into your ps terminal: 
mongod --config ./server/mongodMain.conf and press enter. 4) After this, a plethora of text will be output to your terminal, and 
then the terminal will be in a loop. 5) Once this occurs, open up a new ps terminal and type the following command to enter the 
database: mongosh --port 230 . Upon submission, you will be able to connect to the database. As a starter, the syntax for accessing a 
database on the server is: use <<database id>>.
