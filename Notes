1) Need to express in the MERN acronym for our SMS messages and HTTP requests
2) We are looking for a 1x2 grid format for our welcome page, with (1,1)  = about page (1,2) = register page/button .  Alternatively, we have a 1x1 grid format that has BOTH register button and about info on same page
3) We will use UML diagram to display our Backend properly
